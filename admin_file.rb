I hope on admin creation verification main be sent to oher admin along with login url with temp password then he will enter the temp pasword to veriy and reset the new one, then login with the new password, 
same will happen in case of forgot password also , password should be formatted as per the requirements , password should be at least 8 characters long and should contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number and one special character, also send verification email to the admin with the login url with temp password, then admin will enter the temp password to veriy and reset the new one, then login with the new password, 
otp not required for admin or any other user , just send the verification email with the login url with temp password, then user will enter the temp password to veriy and reset the new one, then login with the new password, 




⌘K to generate command
