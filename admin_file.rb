I hope on admin creation verification main be sent to oher admin along with login url with temp password then he will enter the temp pasword to veriy and reset the new one, then login with the new password, 
same will happen in case of forgot password also , password should be formatted as per the requirements , password should be at least 8 characters long and should contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number and one special character, also send verification email to the admin with the login url with temp password, then admin will enter the temp password to veriy and reset the new one, then login with the new password, 
otp not required for admin or any other user , just send the verification email with the login url with temp password, then user will enter the temp password to veriy and reset the new one, then login with the new password, 




⌘K to generate command
logout on fe not working and also confirm whats the logout flow do we require the endpoint also , if yes then need to make change in the be as well 


    consider my current schema design also as they are also designed for this ecommerc only like myntra or meshoo , 
    Design very much scalable schema design which includes nd handle everythings that an ecommerce like myntra or meshoo has , 
    do things by step by step first design the complete schema, dont write the model code for now we will see later , then approach step by step that an big giant companies does for development , and it will easier for you as well give all the code step by step  
    if required drop all migration re-write all the migration , 
    I think in one go things will not generate , split the design in chunks 2 or 3 so that it will be easy for processing the response and limit will not exceed 



for supplier why we are giving the navigation or search , wishlist or cart , also not seeing proper editible for supplier details 

check everything from pase 1 to phase 6 if any if left or any issue , any security measure , code refacting , any scalibility , maintainability required And any errors are there, in both fe n be 

check all the api functionaltiy by hittin gthe api , also check all the workin gof components also integrated api by trigerring them ,
in full application

Now you act as a supplier and check everything 




## Payment Gateway Integration 
# Payment Gateway Integration — status
# Status: Infrastructure ready, gateway integration pending
# What's in place:
# Payment API endpoints (PaymentsController)
# Payment model and database schema
# Payment method selection UI
# Refund functionality structure
# Support for multiple payment methods
# What's needed (separate integration phase):
# Stripe/Razorpay SDK integration
# Payment gateway service implementation
# Webhook handlers
# Payment gateway API keys setup
# Testing with sandbox mode
# Note: This requires:
# Payment gateway account setup (Stripe/Razorpay)
# API keys configuration
# Webhook setup
# Testing in sandbox mode
# This is typically handled as a separate integration phase.
